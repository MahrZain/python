      <button class="accordion">Are there any side Effects?</button>

      <button class="accordion">When will I see results?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        Results vary from person to person. Some people see change in days while
        for others it may take weeks if not months. This depends on a number of
        factors including your Age, Lifestyle and genetics.

        Do you guy give a Guarantee for the Growth products?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        Our Ingredients are our Guarantee! The products are made from the
        highest quality ingredients that are known to promote growth. The growth
        oil for instance has castor oil, an ingredient that has been used for
        centuries to promote growth, along with essential proteins and amino
        acids. The vitamin spray has biotin, an essential vitamin in
        strengthening not just your hair but your nails too! The shampoo has
        caffeine. Why caffeine you ask? Caffeine is known to draw blood to the
        skin and improve circulation. That helps draw nutrition to the follicles
        and stimulates them to increase active growth! Change takes time. You
        have to be consistent and believe in the journey :)

      </div>
      <button class="accordion">Why are the Growth products expensive?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        We import the highest quality ingredients to formulate our products. For
        Example the castor oil we use in the Growth oil is the Jamaican Castor
        oil that is a very fine quality oil and is thin and non-greasy. Biotin
        is another such Ingredient that is very expensive and cannot be sourced
        locally. So yes the products may be on the expensive side but they are
        formulated with the highest regard to quality hence the price
      </div>
      <div class="panel"></div>
      <button class="accordion">
        Which product from the Growth Line should i start with?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        All of the products have been formulated with ingredients that promote
        growth. The Growth oil has Castor oil and a rich blend of essential
        amino acids and proteins that will nourish your beard, the Growth
        shampoo has caffeine in it that draw blood to the skin and better help
        in absorbing the nutrients. The Vitamin spray has Biotin in it that will
        facilitate the growth by eliminating a deficiency of Biotin or essential
        vitamins to the skin. So yes each individual product has the ability to
        promote growth but when used together you will be able to go full force
        with your beard. So we recommend you use the whole kit!

      <button class="accordion">
        I am on a budget and want to buy just one product?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        You can start with the Growth Oil, it contains Castor oil and Avocado
        oil which will help in nourishing the hair follicle and thereby
        promoting the growth of hair and making it thicker. Also, the oil is
        enriched with essential amino acids and proteins that help strengthen
        the hair leading to less hair fall and breakage. The oil will definitely
        help but we still suggest to use the products together to obtain the
        full benefits.
      </div>
      <div class="panel"></div>
      <button class="accordion">Can I eat Biotin as well?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        Your skin in the largest organ and anything you put gets absorbed. The
        spray not just contains biotin but a blend of essential vitamins too.
        You can definitely use Biotin supplements and consume a diet rich in
        Biotin along with using the Vitamin spray.
